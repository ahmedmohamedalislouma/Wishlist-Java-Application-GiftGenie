# GiftGenie: A User-friendly Wishlist Java Application

GiftGenie is a Java-based wishlist application that allows users to easily create and share wishlists with their friends. The application is built on a client-server-sockets model where the client is connected to the server through input and output streams by opening a socket between them. The server is connected to a Derby database where all data is stored and retrieved.

## Purpose
The purpose of this application is to enable users to share and receive wish lists and gifts.

## Login (Genie-1)
To store wish lists, the application saves user data such as name, email, and password. This data is then stored in a database. When the user opens the application, they will be required to log in to their account to access their wishlists. If the user does not have an account, they will have the option of creating a new account.

## Creating a Wishlist (Genie-2)
Users can create wishlists for different events and add items to their wishlist. A user can add an item from the "Add Item" scene. 

## Viewing Wishlists (Genie-3)
Users can view all the items they have added to their wishlists, and check the remaining and gross price of each item. They can also check when an item is ready to be claimed.

## Adding Friends (Genie-4)
Users can add friends to their list and share wishlists with them. To add a friend, a user can search for their name or username. Users can also unfriend a friend if they want to. A user can view their friend's wishlist and contribute any amount if they have enough cash. 

## Contribution (Genie-5)
Users can charge any amount they want with a credit card or play a game to gain money depending on their score in the game. They can use the money to contribute to their friend's wishlist.

## Settings (Genie-6)
Users can change the background of all scenes, change their phone number, or contact support.

## Help (Genie-7)
Users can access help notes that provide information about how the app works inside the help scene.

## Notifications (Genie-8)
Users can view notifications in all scenes by clicking on the notification icon. They can see the last 7 notifications, such as friend requests, accepted friend requests, contributions, and items ready to be claimed.
